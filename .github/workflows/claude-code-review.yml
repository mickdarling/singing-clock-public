            Review PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} in this repository.

            Read the full diff with `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` and review the changed files in the repo.

            Provide a thorough code review covering:
            1. **Correctness** — logic errors, off-by-one, edge cases, unhandled errors
            2. **Security** — injection risks, unsafe input handling, secrets exposure
            3. **Performance** — unnecessary work, O(n²) where O(n) suffices, missing caching opportunities
            4. **Maintainability** — unclear naming, missing context for tricky logic, overly clever code
            5. **Architecture** — does the approach fit the existing codebase patterns?

            For each issue found, cite the file and line number. Distinguish blocking issues from suggestions.
            If the code looks good, say so — don't invent problems.

            Post your review as a PR comment using `gh pr comment`.
